# orapcs => ora-pcs
Redirection to the "ora-pcs" project repository, which actually resides at "https://github.com/tigormanmsft/ora-pcs/", so please use this URL instead?

ORA-PCS is a project to create a Linux HA cluster using open-source Pacemaker/Corosync (PCS) with a single-instance non-RAC Oracle database as the cluster payload.  Azure Shared Disk is used as the shared storage for the cluster nodes.

This project has nothing to do with Oracle Clusterware or Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC).

Thank you!  My sincere apologies for any confusion.
